+Dhiraj Patel
+New Features:
+-Made mushrooms work. When the ItemBlock is hit, they have a 1/10th chance of containing a mushroom or else a coin, and the mushroom if then collected 
+sets health to 2.
+- added second type of itemblock, called question block, which makes the shrooms, regular blocks have only coins.
+Bugs Added:
+- Before, the shroom block would cause game to freeze and mario was stuck at the block.
+Bugs Fixed:
+- Fixed the freeze problem, by isolating its cause using the print function and then debugging. Works well now!
+Goals:
+- fix the really really annoying error that we dont know why its happening; the one where mario randomly starts teleporting up and down across the screen.
+- Make a new enemy, Goomba or Koopa Troopa's.
